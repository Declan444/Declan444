## Declan Lenahan
# Business Mentor and Full Stack Software Developer

As the founder of Europharma Concepts, I have firsthand knowledge of what it takes to bring a business from concept to commercial success. My experience spans every stage of a startupâ€”idea generation, site selection, process design, quality systems, marketing, and business development. To ensure my approach remains current, I recently completed a Level 9 Professional Diploma in Creativity, Innovation, and Leadership from UCD, strengthening my ability to harness the latest tools and methodologies to drive success. I am also nearing completion of a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development with Code Institute which allows me to mentor companies on their digital needs.
